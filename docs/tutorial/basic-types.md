# Basic Types

Just before we get into the actual types. I want to take a minute to discuss *comments*. Comments are sections of text in your code that the compiler doesn't run. There are 2 kinds:

- **Line comments**: They begin with `#` and run until the end of the line. They are useful for writing a short message about some line of code.

```
# This is a line comment.
```

- **Block comments**: They begin with `#==` and end with `==#`. They can cover multiple lines so they are mostly used for documenting code.

```
#==
This
is
a
block
comment
.
==#
```

## Installation Guide

Welcome!

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Hasdrubal from the most basic syntax to a full stand-alone program.

But before we get there, we first need to install the Hasdrubal executable to have a way of actually running the code. If you have already installed it then you can skip over the rest of this page.

## Prerequisites

The only program that's required by `Hasdrubal` to run is Python 3. The best place to get is directly from [their website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can go there and download the latest Python 3 version for your operating system.

If you are unsure about whether or not you have python on your machine, just open your terminal and run `python --version`. It should tell you something like `Python 3.9.7`. Any version that is equal to or greater than `3.8.0` is good to go so you can skip to the next page in the tutorial. If your version is less than `3.8.0`, then update your local python version. And if you get an error, then you probably don't have python on your machine so you need to download it.

## Installing `hasdrubal`

1. Download the code as a zip file from the GitHub repo.
2. Unzip it in a directory of your choice.
3. `cd` into the project's root directory (which is where the LICENSE and README are).
3. Run `python hasdrubal --version` to ensure that it is properly installed.

For now, you can make a `tutorial.hbl` file just outside the project root directory. Then you can use that file to write code samples. And you can run the, from there using `python hasdrubal ../tutorial.hbl`.

Now that we're done with that, onwards to the tutorial!

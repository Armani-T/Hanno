# Tutorial Introduction

Welcome!

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Hasdrubal from the syntax to how to build fully-fledged programs. But before we get there, we first need to install the Hasdrubal executable to have a way of actually running the code.

## Installing

1. Download the code as a zip file from the GitHub repo.
2. Unzip it in a directory of your choice, if you want to run hasdrubal from anywhere, then put it in a directory that is in `$PATH`.
3. `cd` to the project's root directory (which is where the README is).
4. Run `python hasdrubal --version` to ensure you installed it with the correct version.

For now, you can make a `tutorial.hbl` file and put it somewhere in your file system. You will be writing code samples in and running them from there by executing `python hasdrubal tutorial.hbl`.

If you're done with that, now we can move on to the tutorial itself!
